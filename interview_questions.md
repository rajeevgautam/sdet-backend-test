Q1: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. You should expect something like the following 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz ...

Q2: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 are the first 1-7 numbers of the fibonacci sequence, print out the 35th number (9227465) eg. Printing out the 7th number will print out 13.

Q3: Write a program that checks to see if every number between 1 and 1000 is both larger than 10 and a palindrome (i.e. "Radar") and outputs the numbers that are. You should expect something like the following 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101...
